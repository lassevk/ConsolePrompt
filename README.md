This project implements a simple console program that I use in conjunction with TCC/LE from [JPSoft](http://jpsoft.com).

It will spit out a prompt string for use with the console program to produce a console prompt containing some information:

* Whether I'm running in an elevated console
* Which user I'm currently logged in as
* The current directory
* Git repository with status
